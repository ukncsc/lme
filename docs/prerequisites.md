# Prerequisites


## What kind of IT skills do I need to install LME?


We are pitching this at the skill level of a systems administrator or enthusiast. If you have ever…


* Installed a Windows server and connected it to an Active Directory domain
* Ideally deployed a Group Policy Object (GPO)
* Changed firewall rules
* Installed a Linux operating system, and logged in over SSH.



… then you are likely to have the skills to install LME!

We estimate that you should allow a couple of days to run through the entire installation process, though you can break up the process to fit your schedule. Whilst we have automated steps where we can, and made the instructions as detailed as possible, this is not going to be as easy as using an installation wizard.

## How much does LME cost?

This project (scripts, documentation, and so on) is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

The design uses free and open-source software, we will maintain a pledge to ensure that no paid software licences are needed above standard infrastructure costs (With the exception of Windows Operating system Licensing).

You will need to pay for hosting, bandwidth and time.


## Navigating this document

A **Chapter Overview** appears at the top of each chapter to briefly signpost the work of the following section.

Text in **bold** means that you have to make a decision, or take an action that need particular attention.


Text in *italics* are an easy way of doing something, such as running a script. Double check you are comfortable doing this. A longer, manual, way is also provided.


``` Text in boxes is a command you need to type ```


You should follow each chapter in order, and complete the checklist at the end before continuing.

## Scaling the solution
To keep LME simple, our guide only covers single server setups. It’s difficult to estimate how much load the single server setup will take.
It’s possible to scale the solution to multiple event collectors and ELK nodes, but that will require more experience with the technologies involved.

## Required infrastructure

To begin your Logging Made Easy installation, you will need access to (or creation of) the following servers:

* A Windows Active Directory. This is for deploying Group Policy Objects (GPO)
* A server with 2 processor cores and at least 8GB RAM. We will install the Windows Event Collector Service on this machine, and set it up as a Windows Event Collector (WEC) and join it to the domain.
   * If budget allows, we recommend having a dedicated server for WEC. If this is not possible, WEC can be setup on an existing server but consider the performance impacts.
   * The WEC server could be Windows Server 2016 (or later) or Windows 8.1 client (or later)
* A Linux server with 2 processor cores and at least 16GB RAM. We will install our database (Elasticsearch) and dashboard software on this machine. This is all taken care of through Docker containers. **DO NOT install Docker from the "Featured Snaps" section of the Ubuntu Server install procedure, we install the Docker community edition later.**
   * The deploy script has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 Long Term Support (LTS).

## Where to install the servers

Servers can be either on premise, in a public cloud or private cloud. It is your choice, but you'll need to consider how to network between the clients and servers.

## What firewall rules are needed?
